I am a 2nd year graduate researcher getting my Ph.D. in Informatics at University of California-Irvine. I am broadly interested in applying human-centered design and research methods to support individuals with their health & well-being. At UCI, I am advised by [Dr. Elena Agapie](http://eagapie.com/). Prior to UCI, I got my masters degree in HCI from Georgia Tech and a Bachelors in Engineering in Electronics & Commn from DSCE- VTU Belgaum in India. I was a professional UX/ Product Designer in Chicago, Atlanta, and Bangalore based consultancies and startups for about 6 years. Outside of work, I am the executive producer of a monthly broadcast as a volunteer at Women Making News and wanna-be horse caretaker.
